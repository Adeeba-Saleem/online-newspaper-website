Today we live in the age of technology and digitalization, where majority of the population are relying on them in every aspect of life. Information and media are no exception to this. Gone are the days where people used to rely on printed newspapers and radios, as the primary source of information. 21st century has seen drastic change in peopleâ€™s lifestyle, with social media and internet technology playing a major role in the way they seek information.
It is not surprising to see such a transformation, as people are on the go for most part of their life, which gives no room to dedicate time for reading a newspaper. Hence introduction of digital platforms such as online news portals are a gratuity to the current generation. Thanks to these modern facilities, one can effectively use his time he spends in traffic jam to update himself on current affairs using their tabs and mobile phones.
With this background knowledge, I believe that there are several opportunities for improvement and for growth in future. Therefore, I intend to launch of an online Newspaper website system as my mini project. I strongly believe that successful completion may also give opening for a future career.
